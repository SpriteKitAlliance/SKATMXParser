#SKAToolKit
SKAToolKit is a free set of tools created by the Sprite Kit Alliance to be used with Apples Sprite Kit framework. One of the biggest features is the SKATiledMap which is a simple solution for creating a map using the free Tiled Map Editor http://www.mapeditor.org/. 

The Sprite Kit Alliance is happy to provide the SKAToolKit free of charge without any warranty or guarantee (see license below for more info). If there is a feature missing or you would like added please email Skyler at skyler@skymistdevelopment.com.

##SKAToolKit Install Instructions
- Copy all files in SKAToolKit folder into your project
- Import either SKATiledMap or any SKA file you want
- Link to `libz.dylib` in the “Linked Frameworks and Libraries” section of your project file

##SKATiledMap
This is a sprite node that represents a map created in Tiled. Currently SKATiledMap only supports JSON format. Add the JSON file and any images used for your tiles into your project.

###Resolution Support

####Normal Tilesets
It is important that you make your map in Tiled using 1x assets. When you are ready to bring it into your app for best results provide 1x, @2x, and @3x assets. Keep in mind that there limitation with SpriteKit and texture sizes. Make sure your 1x assets do not exceed 675 x 675 (when at 3x they would be 2025 under the 2048 limit). Just like tiled you only need to import the images used to create your map. Put these images into an asset catalog for best results. No plist files or reference folders needed.

####Collection Tilesets
Tiled supports collection tilesets. Make sure you design your map with 1x graphics. You can provide 1x and 2x .atlas or .atlasc folders containing the same image names you used to create your tile map. Remember to add .atlas and .atlasc folders to Xcode as reference folders. At the moment @3x is not supported in atlas folders.

###Supported Map Types

####TMX
TMX support is in its early stages but is now supported. Make sure you include your .tmx and locate all images you used for your map and import those along with any @2x and @3x version of those images (if using normal tilesets) or create atlas folders (if using collection tilesets). See Resolution Support for more info. SKATiledMap will look for a TMX file before it looks for a JSON file. If a feature is missing please contact skyler@skymistdevelopment.com

    SKATiledMap *map = [[SKATiledMap alloc]initWithMapName:@"yourMapName"]; //name of your TMX file
    
####JSON
SKATileMap supports Tiled Maps that are exported in the JSON format. In Tiled export your map as a JSON file and import it into your app. Make sure you locate all images you used for your map and import those along with any @2x and @3x version of those images (if using normal tilesets) or create atlas folders (if using collection tilesets). See Resolution Support for more info.

To create a map it is a simple matter of calling this method.

    SKATiledMap *map = [[SKATiledMap alloc]initWithMapName:@"yourMapName"]; //name of your JSON file
    
###Useful Methods
	//Use this to convert a map CGPoint on your map into an x y index on your map. This can be useful for looking at tiles around a player or doing manual collision detection.
    -(CGPoint)indexForPoint:(CGPoint)point;

    //This methods will return SKASprites around a given point or index on the map.
    -(NSArray *)tilesAroundPoint:(CGPoint)point inLayer:(NSInteger)layer;
    -(NSArray *)tilesAroundIndex:(CGPoint)point inLayer:(NSInteger)layer;

	//This method can be used to to get a specific tile on a specific layer
    -(SKASprite *)spriteOnLayer:(NSInteger)layerNumber indexX:(NSInteger)x indexY:(NSInteger)y;

	//This method is used to get custom named objects that you may have made in Tiled for spawning enemies, player start positions, or any other custom game logic you made a object for.
    -(NSArray *)objectsOnLayer:(NSInteger)layerNumber withName:(NSString *)name;
    
###Culling Feature
SKATiledMap now has a culling feature. Use this for big maps when you need better performance. The method is optimized to be called in the update loop and will set each sprite to hidden outside of the specified range.

    CGPoint playerIndex = [self.map indexForPoint:self.player.position];
    [self.map cullAroundIndexX:playerIndex.x indexY:playerIndex.y columnWidth:5 rowHeight:5]; //for best resutls set a little wider/higher than your viewing area
    
![SKAMiniMap Example](Documentation/culling.png)

    
    
###Using Layers
All layers are available. To do cool things with. For example you can take a layer and add a blinking effect for light sprites you may have.

    SKAction *fadeOut = [SKAction fadeAlphaTo:0 duration:.5];
    SKAction *fadeIn = [SKAction fadeAlphaTo:1 duration:.5];
    
    SKAction *repeat = [SKAction repeatActionForever:[SKAction sequence:@[fadeOut, fadeIn]]];
    
    SKASpriteLayer *layer =  self.map.spriteLayers[2];
    
    [layer runAction:repeat];

###SKATiledMap Auto Follow Feature
The SKATiledMap has an auto follow feature. This is a great feature if you want the map to position itself and keep a player on screen. To use this feature set the autoFollowNode to any subclass of SKNode and call the maps update method in the scene update method. 

    self.player = [SKATestPlayer spriteNodeWithColor:[SKColor greenColor] size:CGSizeMake(40, 80)];
    self.player.zPosition = 20;
    self.player.position = CGPointMake(400, 400);
    [self.map addChild:self.player];
    
    self.map.autoFollowNode = self.player;
    
    -(void)update:(NSTimeInterval)currentTime
    {
        [self.map update];
    }

###Auto Collision Generation
When creating your Tiled map SKATiledMap will create physical bodies if it finds these properties on a tile or object.

- SKACollisionType : SKACollisionTypeRect

###ZPosition and Optimization
SKATiledMap is optimized for `ignoresSiblingOrder`. Make sure you set your SKView to `skView.ignoresSiblingOrder = YES;` The zPosition is as follows. Layer one tiles will be at zPosition 0 and layer two will be at zPosition 1. SKATiledMap also maximizes draw calls. You will only have as many draw calls as you have sprite maps.


##SKATestHud and SKATestPlayer
The SKATestHud and SKATestPlayer are used to quickly test a map without having to create any custom code. SKATestHud default zPosition is 100.

Example

    self.player = [SKATestPlayer spriteNodeWithColor:[SKColor greenColor] size:CGSizeMake(40, 80)];
    self.player.zPosition = 20;
    self.player.position = CGPointMake(400, 400);
    [self.map addChild:self.player];
    
    SKATestHud *testHud = [SKATestHud hudWithScene:self.scene withPlayer:self.player];
    
    [self addChild:testHud];


##SKAButtonSprite
SKAButtonSprite is a simple sprite button. It can be created using any SKSpriteNode inits or convince methods. IMPORTANT you must set userInteractionEnabled = YES;

Optional Delegate Methods

    -(void)buttonSpritePressed:(SKAButtonSprite *)buttonSprite;
    -(void)buttonSpriteDown:(SKAButtonSprite *)buttonSprite;
    -(void)buttonSpriteUp:(SKAButtonSprite *)buttonSprite;

Example 

    self.buttonLeft = [SKAButtonSprite spriteNodeWithColor:[UIColor blueColor] size:CGSizeMake(50, 50)];
    self.buttonLeft.position = CGPointMake(self.buttonLeft.size.width/2+padding, self.buttonLeft.size.height/2+padding);
    self.buttonLeft.name = @"buttonLeft";
    self.buttonLeft.userInteractionEnabled = YES;
    self.buttonLeft.delegate = self;
    [self addChild:self.buttonLeft];
    
##SKAMiniMap
SKAMiniMap creates a mini map of any node that you pass in. The node you pass in must be part of a scene with a view

![SKAMiniMap Example](Documentation/skaminimap.png)



##SKACroppedMiniMap
SKACroppedMiniMap is similar to SKAMiniMap, but instead of seeing the entire map at once you can choice a viewport size.

###SKACroppedMiniMap AutoFollowFeature
SKACroppedMiniMap has an auto follow feature. Set the autoFollowNode to a node that is a child of the map used to create the SKACroppedMiniMap.
